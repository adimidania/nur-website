# Nur Website

## 📝 About the website

This is a fictional landing page for Nur Application. Nur Application is a prototype for a mobile application that can help kids (as well as adults) to live by the Quran. I worked on this alongside my partner Rania FatmaZohra Rezkellah as part of our participation in the Quranthon organized by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

I didn't finish working on the website as I was running out of time but anyway 🙈.
