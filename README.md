# Nur Website

## 📝 About the website

This is a fictional landing page for Nur. Nur is a prototype for a mobile application that helps kids (as well as adults) live by the Quran. I worked on it alongside my partner Rania FatmaZohra Rezkellah while participating in the Quranthon organized by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

I didn't finish working on the website as I was running out of time but I am putting it public anyway 🙈.

If you are interested in learning more about Nur, you can check our [detailed document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JpjcsZQOxRwaZRE9WtuI5o5PV1ryzTm9/view?usp=sharing). We are very happy to receive feedback/suggestions!
