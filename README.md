# Nur Website

## 📝 About the website

This is a fictional landing page for Nur Application. Nur Application is a prototype for a mobile application that can help kids (as well as adults) live by the Quran. I worked on this alongside my partner Rania FatmaZohra Rezkellah as part of our participation in the Quranthon organized by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

I didn't finish working on the website as I was running out of time but anyway 🙈.

Are you interested in learning more about Nur? Check our [detailed document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JpjcsZQOxRwaZRE9WtuI5o5PV1ryzTm9/view?usp=sharing). We are happy to receive feedback/suggestions!
